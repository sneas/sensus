## How it works

Every time you type a text in the comment textarea on GitHub, Sensus:

1. Sends the text of your comment to the Analyze Lambda packages/backend/src/lambdas/analyze/index.ts
1. Analyze Lambda passes the text of your comment to ChatGPT as a part of a prompt that returns JSON with values
1. Analyze Lambda calculates and returns the Constructiveness Score - a number between 1 and 5
1. The Constructiveness Score is shown in the top right corner of the comment textarea

## How to build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
